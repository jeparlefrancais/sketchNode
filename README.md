# SketchNode

SketchNode is a nodal programming plugin for Roblox.

[Official website](https://jeparlefrancais.github.io/sketchNode/index.html)

### Installation

Since the project is early in development, we haven't put it on the Roblox plugin catalog yet.
You will need *Python* to run the plugin builder.

```
Run build_plugin.py
```

The plugin will be located in the *builds* folder. You can drag the *sketchNode_plugin.rbxmx* file in your folder. If you want to automatically load the plugin in the proper folder, create a file called *build_locations.txt* next to the build_plugin.py The content of this file should look similar to this:

```
C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Roblox\Plugins
```
